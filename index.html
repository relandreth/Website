					<p> 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I'm Roderick Landreth, and I'm graduating as a Mechanical Engineering Major with a minor in physics from Union College in June of 2020. I'm very interested in thermo-fluid systems and aerospace design, taking part in SAE Aero international design competition for four years at Union, and loving and excelling in classes related to fluids, heat transfer and thermodynamics. I'm willing to travel for work as much as moving across country until I find something interesting. My goal is to spend several years in industry before going back to graduate school so that I can specialize in my exact point of passion.</p>
					<p> 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As team captain of the Aero team in 2018, we placed third in an international event against aeronautic acadamies when Union does not even have an aero major. I've been a leadership mentor for Freshman coming to college, attained the rank of Eagle Scout and served as SPL, and was team captain for highschool FRC. Feel free to contact me from any of the available options below.</p>
