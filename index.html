			<h1>About Me </h1>

			<p1> 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I'm Roderick Landreth, and though this site isn't finished, I'm a Mechanical Engineer out of San francisco with an M.E. Bachelors and a minor in physics from Union College Class of 2020. I've been employed at Sherpa 6 for the last 4 years working on design and rapid prototyping, some light software dev and network engineering. Overall I am very interested in the fields of rapid prototyping, thermo-fluid systems and aerospace design. I'm willing to travel for work as much as moving across country until I find something interesting. My goal is to spend several more years in industry before going back to graduate school so that I can further specialize.
			<br> 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As team captain of Union College's SAE Aero internation design competition team in 2018, we placed third in an international event against aeronautic acadamies when Union does not even have an aero major. I've been a leadership mentor for Freshman coming to college, attained the rank of Eagle Scout and served as SPL, and was team captain for highschool FRC. Feel free to contact me from any of the available options below.(Hopefully below, I did write the CSS for this site, too, and will be improving it.)</p1>
